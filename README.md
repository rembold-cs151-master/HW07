# Homework 7

Assignment Status: PENDING

_Please change the above to DONE when you finish and want the assignment to be graded!_

Due the night of Oct 17 at midnight


## Instructions
The homework pdf has the basic instructions, and you should definitely read the docstrings, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Make sure you remember to upload a pdf again on this assignment, as Problem 1 has written work.
 - [ ] Read through the docstrings before getting started! They have important information!
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob2.py` to find and output prime factors.

__Remember to fill out the commented metadata at the top of each Python script!__

#### Testing
 - Prob 2
 	- Automated tests will check return values of all template functions
	- Automated tests will not check what is printed to screen, I will test
	that myself (and you should test it yourself as well!)
